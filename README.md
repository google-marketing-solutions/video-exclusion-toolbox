# Youtube Ads Data Toolbox

By running ads on Youtube, an advertiser can only pull high level details of
where their ads showed (name and URL). It's then hard to spot patterns of
unwanted channels/videos and decide what to exclude.

The Youtube Ads Data Toolbox pulls your ads reports from your selected accounts
and enhances it with Youtube Data. This allows you to filter your data based
on additional criteria and helps you exclude unwanted videos/channels.

If your use case is to automatically exclude spam channels, please refer to the
[Ads Placement Excluder](https://github.com/google/ads-placement-excluder)
solution, which was used as a the base structure for this project.

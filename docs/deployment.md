# Video Exclusion Toolbox Deployment

This doc provides information on how to deploy the Video Exclusion Toolbox.

The deployment uses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to automate the
deployment, and to keep all the Infrastructure as Code (IaC). The files can be
found in the `/terraform/` folder in this repo.

## Roles
The project creates a service account with the following roles:

- `roles/cloudfunctions.invoker`
- `roles/bigquery.jobUser`
- `roles/bigquery.dataEditor`
- `roles/pubsub.publisher`
- `roles/storage.objectAdmin`
- `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`
- `roles/cloudbuild.builds.builder`
- `roles/run.invoker`
- `roles/aiplatform.user`

As a user deploying the project, you will require these roles and the following:

- `roles/storage.admin`
- `roles/iam.securityAdmin`

Read more about [Google Cloud roles here](
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles).

## OAuth
The project uses OAuth 2.0 scopes and service account roles to manage
permissions. These are the scopes that are required when generating a refresh
token.

```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
```

## Pre-requisites

- A new Google Cloud Project
- Appropriate permissions to be able to deploy the project (see [roles](#roles))
- Create a copy of [the template Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/131Lfxw54bath7bsyhAcMHLG99rKkhL9XSTtMPsnZNTk/copy?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-FtYQ8IxkFXRNQwim61iQbQ)
  and make a note of the Google Sheet ID (found in the URL after the `/d/`)
- Access to the appropriate Google Ads accounts
- A Google Ads [Developer Token](
  https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token)

## Deployment

### Manual Steps
These changes need to be done once manually, as they are not controlled by
Terraform:

1. If you want to use the sample Looker Studio dashboard to display the data,
request access to
[this dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/c/reporting/2194043e-84bb-432b-b3e6-0553369745be).
The deployment process will prompt you to create a copy of it later on.
Once you've been granted access, proceed with the next step.
This is optional and you can create your own dashboards to connect to the
BigQuery datasets.

1. Open the Google Cloud Project in the UI.

1. Go to [Cloud Storage](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser) and
   create a new bucket, which will be used to keep track of the Terraform state,
   e.g. `my-awesome-project-terraform`. Make a note of the name of the bucket.
   
1. Open the [OAuth Consent Screen](
   https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) and create a new
   internal app.
1. Open the [API Credentials Screen](
   https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) -> Create credentials ->
   OAuth Client ID -> Web app -> Set
   `https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground` as an authorised redirect
   URI. Make a note of the `client_id` and the `client_secret`.
1. Open the [OAuth playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/#step1&scopes=https%3A//www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly%20https%3A//www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform%20https%3A//www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube%20https%3A//www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords&useDefaultOauthCred=checked),
   and generate a refresh token for the [above scopes](#oauth), using the
   `client_id` and `client_secret` generated in the previous step
1. Open Cloud Shell:
   ![cloud-shell](./images/cloud-shell.png)
1. Enable the APIs in the project by running the following:

   ```
   gcloud services enable \
      serviceusage.googleapis.com \
      cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com \
      iam.googleapis.com \
      bigquery.googleapis.com \
      googleads.googleapis.com \
      youtube.googleapis.com \
      cloudfunctions.googleapis.com \
      cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
      sheets.googleapis.com \
      cloudscheduler.googleapis.com \
      secretmanager.googleapis.com \
      vision.googleapis.com \
      pubsub.googleapis.com \
      run.googleapis.com \
      eventarc.googleapis.com \
      aiplatform.googleapis.com
   ```

_Side note_: If you're interested in the reason why the APIs aren't controlled
through Terraform, [read this guide](
https://medium.com/rockedscience/how-to-fully-automate-the-deployment-of-google-cloud-platform-projects-with-terraform-16c33f1fb31f).

### Terraform

1. Whilst still in Cloud shell, `git clone` the project, and `cd` into the
   directory.
1. Run the following commands to initialise Terraform:
   ```
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   ```
   When prompted, enter the name of the bucket created in step 2 in manual
   steps.

1. Create a file named `terraform.tfvars` and add the following variables:
   ```
   project_id = ""
   oauth_refresh_token = ""
   google_cloud_client_id = ""
   google_cloud_client_secret = ""
   google_ads_developer_token = ""
   google_ads_login_customer_id = ""
   config_sheet_id = ""
   ```
   Note that the `google_ads_login_customer_id` is the MCC customer ID in Google
   Ads.

1. Run `terraform plan` and review the proposed changes.
1. Run `terraform apply` to create the infrastructure.
1. The email of the service account created will be output, give view only
   access to the Google sheet containing the config.

By default, the code will be triggered every hour by Cloud Scheduler. You can
run it less often by updating the Cloud Scheduler trigger.
To test everything is working, configure the Google Sheet ([see below](#google-sheet)) and force run the Cloud Scheduler job in the UI.

## Google Sheet

Open your copy of the Google Sheet. This is what you'll be using to configure
the Video Exclusion Toolbox solution.

There are notes in the Sheet that contain instructions for how to set this up.
